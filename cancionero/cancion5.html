    Searching for the thrill of it, thrill of it, <br>
    Say that it's love, but to me it's looking counterfeit, <br>
    I get done with one and move on to another bitch <br>
    Yea college educated, she graduated <br>
    Any bill she can't front, her parents paid it <br>
    The show was far, you're the only one with a car <br>
    And your girlfriends, bein that she's a big fan, of course she made it <br>
    Most girls wanna hide the fact that the thrill they chase it <br>
    But you, just wanna get drunk tonight and fuck someone famous <br>
    So I just name a time and a place and your game for it <br>
    Value player, hotel room, meet you there
    <p></p>
    Walking on a dream <br>
    How can I explain <br>
    Talking to myself <br>
    Just travelin' the world <br>
    (Will I see again) <br>
    Tryin' different drugs and girls
    <p></p>
    {We are always running for the thrill of it, thrill of it <br>
    Always pushing up the hill searching for the thrill of it <br>
    On and on and on we are calling out and out again <br>
    Never looking down, I'm just in awe of what's in front of me}
    <p></p>
    And I'm addicted to champagne <br>
    Fuck the room we buy the hallway <br>
    Bitches I Taylor Gang that <br>
    They just wanna know where the planes at
    <p></p>
    Take the little one outta there <br>
    Or like, just turn it down <br>
    And then I'm um probably just gonna go back smoke another one in an hour <br>
    Just get real airy, fuckin' dreamy and shit
    <p></p>
    Wake up drunk go to sleep fucked up <br>
    We both amazed at what we just done <br>
    Mixin' drinks, knowin we'll regret this <br>
    Ain't been asleep yet, room service bringin' us breakfast <br>
    All this money, darlin, what else is left to do <br>
    But smoke an enjoy my presidential view <br>
    Got a swimmin pool in my living room <br>
    On stage, interviews, tons of sour, let's consume
    <p></p>
    We are always running for the thrill of it, thrill of it <br>
    Always pushing up the hill searching for the thrill of it <br>
    On and on and on we are calling out and out again <br>
    Never looking down, I'm just in awe of what's in front of me
    <p></p>
    And I'm addicted to champagne <br>
    Fuck the room, we buy the hallway <br>
    Bitches I Taylor Gang that <br>
    They just wanna know where the planes at
    <p></p>
    And I'm addicted to champagne <br>
    Fuck the room, we buy the hallway <br>
    Bitches I Taylor Gang that <br>
    They just wanna know where the planes at
    <p></p>
    What's this? <br>
    Burn after rollin? <br>
    Yeah, that's what it is <br>
    Until I drop the next one <br>
    It's just that
    <p></p>
    Catch me I'm falling down <br>
    Catch me I'm falling down
    <p></p>
    Don't stop, just keep going on <br>
    I'm your shoulder lean upon <br>
    So come on, deliver from inside
    All we got is tonight that is right till first light <br>
    <p></p>
    I'm stoned <br>
    This is what, mix tape number 6? 7? <br>
    I don't know, but um, good weeds still in the building <br>
    Your bitch still hittin me on whatever I use on the computer these days <br>
    Everything's going how it's supposed to be <br>
    Yes, Taylor Gang over everything

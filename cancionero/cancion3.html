    You call me on the telephone, you feel so far away <br>
    You tell me to come over, there some games you wanna play <br>
    I'm walking to your house, nobody's home <br>
    Just me and you and you and me alone
    <p></p>
    We're just playing hide and seek <br>
    It's getting hard to breathe under the sheets with you <br>
    I don't want to play no games <br>
    I'm tired of always chasing, chasing after you
    <p></p>
    I don't give a fuck about you anyways <br>
    Who ever said I give shit about you? <br>
    You never share your toys or communicate <br>
    I guess I'm just a play date to you
    <p></p>
    Wake up in your bedroom and there's nothing left to say <br>
    When I try to talk, you're always playing board games <br>
    I wish I had monopoly over your mind <br>
    I wish I didn't care all the time
    <p></p>
    We're just playing hide and seek <br>
    It's getting hard to breathe under the sheets with you <br>
    I don't want to play no games <br>
    I'm tired of always chasing, chasing after you
    <p></p>
    I don't give a fuck about you anyways <br>
    Who ever said I give shit about you? <br>
    You never share your toys or communicate <br>
    I guess I'm just a play date to you
    <p></p>
    Ring around the rosy <br>
    I never know, I never know what you need <br>
    Ring around the rosy <br>
    I want to give you, want to give you what you need
    <p></p>
    I don't give a fuck about you anyways <br>
    Who ever said I give shit about you? <br>
    You never share your toys or communicate <br>
    I guess I'm just a play date to you
    <p></p>
    You know I give a fuck about you everyday <br>
    Guess it's time I tell you the truth <br>
    If I share my toys, will you let me stay? <br>
    Don't want to leave this play date with you
